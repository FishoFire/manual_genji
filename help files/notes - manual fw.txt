todo:
- output orbs, kills, cps etc found. make easy to copy format
vect tab radius/setings tab etc
- check if i already fixed the sub not detecting thing
- wrap more things in try catch
- version log:
    - load button grey out if nothing to load
    - now has a load page that atempt to display what is going on isntead of a mesage baner on top.

long term:
- turn extension setings into actual extension settings
- make test thing: auto input and convert serveral datas and check if loaded data matches the desired results. store in input file and result file. only relevant data so it doesnt brick when i add more map data.

- d1qfv = 1) converting kill orbs doesnt work 2) not reset bug on old fw but not on new
---------------------------
detect subs

- detect subs as seperate from rules
some detection breaks because subs arent seperate from rules
- they look like rules so its tricky

- rule check doesnt take into account "\ndef Sub0()"

def .... :
"\ndef "

check for next rule
store
ceheck if next sub
if sub is sooner then store else ignore
cut off using number if possible, but perhaps need to split because cut requires the name


---------------------------
orb thing

- orbs and kils that are global dont get detected
- first have to change how orbs/lava gets added to, because it ignores cp soemtimes
- on detecting this problem, buttns for solutions
- try add to every cp, only work when enough fx
- try add to only 1 cp and make user copy it themselves


---------------------------
insepctor to pasta

normally doesnt work because its not a rule and cant detect rule
ignoring rule is problem because translations

bypass: put ur data in a rule

other solution: try find how to either turn into a temp rule or detec
