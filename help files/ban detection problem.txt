problem:
- in old fw they used extension names
- in newest version of our own fw i renamed extensions again
- in my web interface i set them via true/false in default instead of extensions settings
- our ban per cp should be detacble
- old bans are often manual rules per ban

A proper detection would be able to check for all these.

if any of them true then set ban true, else default to false




 "Ban Triple Jump"
BhopBanToggle =  "Ban Double Bhop" = create
 "Ban Multiclimb" 
BhopBanFromReset "Ban bhop from reset" = deathbhop
"Ban Emote" emote

		Ban bhop from reset: On
		Ban Emote: On
		Ban Multiclimb: On
		Ban Triple Jump: On
