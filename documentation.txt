general workings:
    interface settings get turned into workshop code
    the variables get inserted into a version of the template
    this gets copied to clipboard
    if another client langauge is selected then it first converts it via decompile+recompile in overpy

list of [1] of every cp that has enabled


update overpy version:
    during my troubleshooting i found that for some reason overpy cant check variable indexes on my code
    it trows errors at variable numbers
    note that it will only trow the error on using overpy, thus not if you compile english
    so compile in diferent langague to check it
    it might only trow error itn the console log. note that this is catched so it doesnt apear red like most errors.

    to fix this, go into the overpy.js file that the web interface uses and disable the check
            find the line by searching for "Invalid index" find the one for variables,
            disable it for both subroutines and variables, by comenting out the error the line that returns the error
            it looks like this:

                if (!isNumber(variable.index) || variable.index >= 128 || variable.index < 0) {
                    error("Invalid index '"+variable.index+"' for "+varType+" variable '"+variable.name+"', must be from 0 to 127");
                }

            comment out the line that starts with "error"

    note that we only need overpy.js the rest of files can be deleted
    but make sure you point to it via the index.html's script loading

change template:
    1) add a new file for it in the template folder
    2) paste the data for the template in the file
    3) replace map settings to allow all skirmrish maps
    4) remove all // comments, overpy puts these on :lbl for some reason this bugs overpy so just remove them
    5) put all the variables in:
        - syntax is:   ${variable name}
            - some variables only contain true,false or a color etc
            - other variables contain the full line of code that sets a variable
            - there is also variables that just add "disabled " to a rule that is suposed ot be on or off
        - the best way to find what it does, is to jsut look at the last template
        - you should probly verify the count of ${ is the same as in last template
    6) in index.html near the end, change the old template file loading to the new template
    
    note: overpy only translates when going in a different langauge, make sure you also test if the translations dont give errors
