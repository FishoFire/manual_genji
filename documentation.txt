general workings:
    
    generate map data:
        variables get turned into ws code
        a var is set to the template, and it inserts those settings vars
        this entire thing gets copied to clipboard
        if another client langauge is selected then it first converts it via decompile+recompile in overpy

    documents
        index has html
        convertperrule has the converter code
        generatethings has all the things that get auto generated based on data, like cp buttons or orbs
        main is the general functions
        save has all save related things saving and loading

    website structure
        the sidebar html contains the buttons that navigat the page with the  changebar function
        everything is just one page, the pages that are not being used are just hidden with html

    Log
        replaces the message feature that was a popup banner before.
        Now its just a html div in wich i add text via the commands.
        LogOpenNew to open the log and clean it
        LogAdd new entry line
        CLS already included in logopennew, just clears screen 

    update overpy version:
        Just replace the overpy master folder with the new folder. 
        You can download the full master from zeozo's main.
        You used to have to comment out the 2x "Invalid index" errors from overpy, but this issue was fixed by changing my function name. So this is no longer required.


    change template:
        If only a small part of the code is changed, it can be easier to swap out that part of the code in the template instead.
        If you do have to replace the entire template follow these steps.
        If you only replace a part of code and the version, just copy the template and renumber it and change the number in index.
        
        1) add a new file for it in the template folder
        2) paste the data for the template in the file
        3) replace map settings to allow all skirmrish maps
        4) remove all // comments, overpy puts these on :lbl for some reason this bugs overpy so just remove them
        5) put all interface variables in:
            - syntax is:   ${variable name}
                - some variables only contain true,false or a color etc
                - other variables contain the full line of code that sets the entire variable
                - there is also variables that just add "disabled " to a rule that is suposed ot be on or off
                - to handle togles i set the default settings to true/false instead of the extension settings
            - the best way to find what it does, is to jsut look at the last template
            - you should probly verify the count of ${ is the same as in last template
        6) in index.html near the end, change the old template file loading to the new template
        
        note: overpy only translates when going in a different langauge, make sure you also test if the translations dont give errors
